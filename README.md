# Sentiment Analysis and Summarization using BERT and T5

## Project Description

The project aims to perform the following tasks:
   1.Identify the overall sentiment of a given text passage
   2.Identify the sentence wise sentiment of all sentences in a given text passage
   3.Generate a title for the passage

## Summarization and BERT model

BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer network developed by Google in 2018 for performing several NLP tasks. It is a neural network based model which is pretrained on two different tasks-Masked Language Modelling(Masking tokens and training bert to predict it) and Next Sentence Prediction(training bert to predict if a chosen sentence would follow a given one). Once fine tuned for a specific task bert is able to perform a variety of NLP tasks such as Sentiment Classification.

The bert model has two variation- bert base and bert large which differ by number of encoder layers.
